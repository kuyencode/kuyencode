###🌸 Hi there 

  My name is Kuyen. I am a Game Design Student. 
  Currently I am very interested in Web Development, especially Front -End Engineering.
  I love UX Design and I'd like to explore this as well. 
  I am currently learning how to make smart contracts on the blockchain. 
  It would be fun to release a game as well.
  
  Oh, and programming art? Yeah that's on my bucketlist.
  
  Basicly, I have a lot of ideas and interests when it comes to IT.
  
  ☕🍪 I'm done talking, let's get back to coding.
